## Setting Up Environment

- `node.js` and `npm` is primarily required to run this project on your local.
- There's no need to have [Angular](https://angular.io) environment but maybe helpful.
- Clone the repository or just download the `.zip` or `.tar.gz` file and extract it.

## Code scaffolding

```bash
# Setting up node_modules (npm packages)
$ npm install
# Run the project on the local
$ npm run start
```

- After following above steps, navigate to `http://localhost:4200` on your browser to check the running website.

## Short Description

Design implementation, functional implementation along with the mobile responsive is the core feature of this test task.

## Implementation Details

- There are two pages `/` (root page - Video Games Page) and `/contact` (contact page - Contact page).
- Both pages are fully mobile responsive in different devices including phone and tablet view.
- Application is storing the data as in a service and work similar as redux pattern but very manually. This will demonstrate that developer is just familiar with all progressive programing.
- Design specifications are correctly implemented using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) along with recommended fonts.
- General code quality is supported by the [Prettier](https://prettier.io) and also IDE configuration. (If you use VS Code, you need to install prettier plugin on your editor.)
- Typescript - Defined all types and models using the typescript to make sure developer is following the best practice and modern cookbooks.
- Using different method of handling asynchronous actions using promise/rxjs and so on, used different methods in different places to show you cases.

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
